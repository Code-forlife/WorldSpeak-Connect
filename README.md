# WorldSpeak-Connect

This repository implements WorldSpeak-Connect, a project that facilitates seamless communication across languages using the powerful SeamlessM4T transformer model. It encompasses both frontend and backend components:

* **Frontend:** Built with Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python, the frontend provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the language translation functionality.
* **Backend:** Leveraging Gradio, a library designed for creating machine learning interfaces, the backend seamlessly integrates the SeamlessM4T model to handle translation requests.

## Getting Started

To set up and run WorldSpeak-Connect, follow these steps:

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Ensure you have Python (version 3.6 or later) installed on your system. You can verify this by running `python --version` in your terminal. If you don't have Python, download it from https://www.python.org/downloads/.
   - Install the required Python libraries:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

2. **Running the Application:**
   - Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
   - Start the Flask development server:
     ```bash
     python app.py
     ```
   - This will typically launch the application at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your web browser. You may need to adjust the port number if it's already in use.

## Usage

The WorldSpeak-Connect web interface provides a straightforward way to translate text between languages:

1. **Access the Application:** Open `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your web browser.
2. **Enter Text:** Type the text you want to translate in the provided text area.
3. **Select Source and Target Languages:** Choose the source language (the language of the original text) and the target language (the language you want to translate to) from the respective dropdown menus.
4. **Translate:** Click the "Translate" button. The application will process your request using the SeamlessM4T model and display the translated text below the input area.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

- `app.py`: The main Flask application file, responsible for routing, handling translation requests, and interacting with the Gradio interface.
- `templates`: Contains HTML templates for the frontend user interface.
- `static`: Stores static assets like CSS and JavaScript files used by the frontend.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the required Python libraries for the project.
- `README.md`: This file (the one you're currently reading).

## Model Information

WorldSpeak-Connect utilizes the SeamlessM4T transformer model for its translation capabilities. For detailed information about the model's architecture, training process, and performance, refer to the relevant documentation or research papers associated with SeamlessM4T (replace with specific details or links if available).
